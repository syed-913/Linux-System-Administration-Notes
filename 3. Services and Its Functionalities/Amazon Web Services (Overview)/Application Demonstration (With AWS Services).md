<center>Let's take a look on <b>facebook.com</b> using Amazon services.</center>

___
### **Requirements**
To deploy an application on-premises we must require:

- **Network:** A private network for security purposes.

- **Architecture:** In that private network, a three-tier architecture to manage at least 100 users.
  - **Web Server:** A virtual machine that manages all the front-end tasks.
  - **Web Application:** A virtual machine that manages all the backend workloads.
  - **Database:** A relational database to manage all (textual data) the data input by the users like passwords, emails, phone numbers, etc.

- **Public IP:** An IP address through which users can access our website. In this case **facebook.com**.
  - There would be a public IP on which our **Web Server** is displayed and accessed by users.

- **Scaling:** If this 3-tier architecture cannot handle the load of the users, then we have to extend it further. There are 2 concepts of scaling:
  - **Horizontal Scaling:** It means adding more Web/App machines to distribute the load between them. We'll be using **Horizontal Scaling** for our Web Application.
  - **Vertical Scaling:** It means increasing the storage capacity of the Web/App servers.

- **NoSQL DB:** For a website like **facebook.com** we must require a NoSQL DB (like MongoDB, Cassandra) along with a relational database to manage website data effectively & efficiently.

- **DB Cache:** A DB cache (like Redis or Memcached) is added to manage the frequently accessed data for our relational database. It is required to avoid bottlenecking in our relational database.

- **Main File Storage:** To manage media files like in **facebook.com**'s case, pictures, videos, audios, etc. These media files (or Binary Large Objects (BLOBs)) cannot be stored in relational DBs or NoSQL DBs, so we must require unlimited media or BLOB storage (like RFS or S3). Mostly cloud storages are used for these scenarios. The metadata of these media files is stored in normal DBs.

- **Content Filter:** It is required to blur pictures and videos that have some objectionable or nudity content.

- **Click Stream Analysis (CSA):** A click stream analysis engine is used to monitor users' activities (like digital footprints left by the users on the platform) and display personalized ads. This area of **facebook.com** is for monetization purposes. I mean **facebook.com** is free, and all of its features are free. So, to monetize this free application, we must require a strategy or business model to earn money from **facebook.com**.
  - **File Storage:** A media or BLOB file storage is required for this side of the application (click stream analysis). To store the data required for displaying personalized ads to users on the platform. It is isolated from other DBs and file storages like the storages for media files of the App server and DBs for the Web server.
  - **Big Data Analysis:** For Web/Apps like **facebook.com**, it is crucial to calculate real-time insights to display personalized ads to the users or present a report of weekly most clicked/liked/viewed posts to recommend the best post to their users to hold them on to their websites. This analysis takes place on distributed systems. For example, Hadoop/Apache Spark.
  - **Data Warehouse:** A data warehouse is required to store the **CSA** logs like trending topics, which regions are more active on the platform, and more. In simple terms, all the calculations done by the analysis engine are stored in this data warehouse.
  - **Business Intelligence:** This tool is used for querying, analyzing, and generating reports for decision-making purposes in the future based on these reports and analyses. As I mentioned, this part of the organization is for monetization and improving user experience purposes.

- **Web Browser:** Another web browser (except the main one) is required so that users can access their pictures, videos, audios, etc. This Web browser gives access to the users to their personal media files.

- **2nd File Storage:** This file storage is required for **mobile users** because they cannot access the web browser directly from the browser. I mean they can, but the mobile application is easier.

- **Video Converter:** It is required for converting the exact copy of media files uploaded by the users on the web browser media file storage to mobile media file storage.

- **Content Delivery Network (Cache):** Let's assume a video goes viral on **facebook.com**, so there would be a bottleneck occurring in our main **BLOB** file storage. To avoid bottlenecks on our main media file storage, we can have a **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** cache to manage that viral video outside our network. I mean that's the frequently viewed video, so it should be managed in a cache storage device to the user's nearest **edge locations**.

- **Mobile Push Notification:** A company like **facebook.com** sends push notifications to the user's lock screen to let them know that someone sent a friend request, liked their post, and more. This concept is performed out of the network.

- **Email:** **facebook.com** also sends emails to the user's personal email address, mostly for security purposes (to ensure their integrity). These can be disabled if they're for purposes other than security.

- **Message Queue:** For messaging and chats between two or more users, **facebook.com** uses queues like first-in-first-out data structures.

- **Monitoring Dashboard:** The monitoring dashboard is used to check the health of systems, monitor malicious activities, troubleshoot errors, and manage other monitoring tasks.
