### **Which Storage Service Should You Use?**

#### **Key Considerations**

1. **Access Patterns**:
    
    - If the application requires **block-level storage** tied to a single EC2 instance, use **EBS**.
    - For shared access across multiple instances, choose **EFS**.
    - If storing large amounts of unstructured data (e.g., backups or media), use **S3**.
2. **Performance**:
    
    - For applications needing **high I/O** and **low latency**, EBS with SSD-backed volumes is ideal (e.g., GP3 or IO2 volumes).
    - For **shared workloads** requiring scalable file systems, EFS provides consistent performance and scalability.
3. **Cost**:
    
    - S3 is the most cost-effective for storing large volumes of data, especially with options like **S3 Glacier** for archival.
    - EBS and EFS are generally more expensive but provide the necessary performance for critical applications.

#### **Recommendation Based on Use Case**

|**Requirement**|**Recommended Service**|**Reason**|
|---|---|---|
|High-performance database|EBS (IO2 or GP3)|Provides low latency and high IOPS.|
|Shared storage for EC2 instances|EFS|Offers shared file system access with scalability.|
|Large-scale backup or archive|S3 or S3 Glacier|Cost-effective, durable, and designed for unstructured data.|
|Hosting static websites|S3|Serves static content directly to users over HTTP/HTTPS.|
|Video streaming or media files|S3|Optimized for storing and distributing media at scale.|
