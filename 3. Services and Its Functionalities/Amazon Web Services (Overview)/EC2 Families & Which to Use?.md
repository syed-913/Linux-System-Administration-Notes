## **EC2 Functionality**

Amazon EC2 provides virtual machines (called instances) by allocating some resources from the physical host computer. Here's how it works:

1. Dedicated Resources: Certain resources like CPU, memory, and storage are reserved specifically for your instance.
2. Shared Resources: Other resources like network and disk subsystems are shared among all instances running on the same host.
	- If everyone uses a shared resource heavily, each instance gets an equal share.
	- If others are not using it much, your instance can use more of that resource.

Instance Types:

- Different instance types provide different levels of access to these shared resources.
	- For example, instances labeled as "high I/O" are designed to handle heavy input/output operations and get a larger share of the shared disk and network resources.
	- This makes their performance more consistent and reliable for demanding applications.
- Most applications are fine with moderate performance, but if your application needs faster and steadier disk or network speeds, choose an instance type with higher I/O performance.

### 1. **Instance Types vs. Purchasing Options**

- **Instance Types**: Define the _hardware configuration_ of the instance, such as CPU, memory, and storage. Examples include **General Purpose, Compute Optimized, Memory Optimized, Storage Optimized, and Accelerated Computing instances**. These are chosen based on your workload needs.
- **Purchasing Options**: Define _how you pay for the instances_ and the _use case_ they’re best suited for:
    - **On-Demand Instances**: Pay-as-you-go. No upfront commitment. Flexible and suitable for unpredictable workloads.
    - **Spot Instances**: Use spare capacity at a discounted rate (up to 90% cheaper). Ideal for fault-tolerant workloads because they can be interrupted.
    - **Dedicated Hosts**: A physical server fully reserved for your use. Best for regulatory or licensing requirements.
    - **Dedicated Instances**: Virtual machines on a physical server dedicated to you. They’re like Dedicated Hosts but less flexible (you don’t control the underlying host).

### 2. **EC2 Families**

The term **EC2 Families** refers to groups of instance types with similar capabilities. Amazon organizes EC2 instances into families based on their primary purpose. Examples:

- **General Purpose (e.g., t4g, m6i)**: Balanced performance across CPU, memory, and storage.
- **Compute Optimized (e.g., c7g)**: Designed for high-performance computing tasks.
- **Memory Optimized (e.g., r6i)**: For applications needing large amounts of memory.
- **Storage Optimized (e.g., i4i)**: Built for applications requiring high disk throughput.
- **Accelerated Computing (e.g., p5)**: For workloads requiring GPUs or FPGAs.

Each family has specific instance types (like t4g.micro, m6i.large, etc.), which vary in resource allocation.

### Putting It Together

- **Types of Instances** (e.g., General Purpose, Compute Optimized) describe _what the instance is good for_.
- **EC2 Families** group instances with similar capabilities together (e.g., all General Purpose instances).
- **On-Demand, Spot, Dedicated Hosts, and Dedicated Instances** are purchasing options that describe _how you pay_ and _how resources are managed_.
