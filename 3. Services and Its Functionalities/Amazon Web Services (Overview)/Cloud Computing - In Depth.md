In [[Cloud Computing - AWS#**Definition**|Cloud Computing]], there are six service models of **Amazon Web Services**, or basically **Cloud Computing**:

##### **Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS)**
Infrastructure as a service, or IaaS, delivers on-demand infrastructure resources to organizations via the cloud, such as compute, storage, networking, and virtualization. Customers don’t have to manage, maintain, or update their own data center infrastructure, but are responsible for the operating system, middleware, virtual machines, and any apps or data.

- **Amazon EC2**: Elastic Compute Cloud for scalable virtual servers (IaaS) - _AWS_.
##### **Containers as a Service(CaaS)**
Containers as a service, or CaaS, delivers and manages all the hardware and software resources to develop and deploy applications using containers. Sometimes viewed as a subset or an extension of IaaS, CaaS uses containers rather than VMs as its main resource. Developers and IT operations teams can use CaaS to develop, run, and manage applications without having to build and maintain the infrastructure or platform to run and manage containers. Customers still have to write the code and manage their data and applications, but the environment to build and deploy containerized apps is managed and maintained by the cloud service provider.

- **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**: Managed Kubernetes for container orchestration (CaaS) -_Google Cloud_.
##### **Platform as a Service(PaaS)**
Platform as a service, or PaaS, delivers and manages all the hardware and software resources to develop applications through the cloud. Developers and IT operations teams can use PaaS to develop, run, and manage applications without having to build and maintain the infrastructure or platform on their own. Customers still have to write the code and manage their data and applications, but the environment to build and deploy apps is managed and maintained by the cloud service provider.

- **Azure App Service**: Platform for deploying web and mobile applications (PaaS) - _Microsoft Azure._
##### **Software as a Service(SaaS)**
Software as a service, or SaaS, provides the entire application stack, delivering an entire cloud-based application that customers can access and use. SaaS products are completely managed by the service provider and come ready to use, including all updates, bug fixes, and overall maintenance. Most SaaS applications are accessed directly through a web browser, which means customers don’t have to download or install anything on their devices.

- **Google Workspace**: Cloud productivity suite with Gmail, Docs, and Drive (SaaS) - _Google_.
##### **Function as a Service(FaaS)**
Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) is a [serverless](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/serverless/what-is-serverless/) way to execute modular pieces of code on the edge. FaaS lets developers write and update a piece of code on the fly, which can then be executed in response to an event, such as a user clicking on an element in a web application. This makes it easy to scale code and is a cost-efficient way to implement [microservices](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/serverless/glossary/serverless-microservice/).

- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless computing for running code on-demand (FaaS) - _AWS_.
##### **Desktop as a Service(DaaS)**
Desktop as a service (DaaS) is a way of delivering complete virtual desktop environments to users, which include operating systems, applications, files and user preferences from the cloud. The desktops run in [virtual machines that are hosted](https://www.ibm.com/topics/virtual-machines) on compute, storage and network infrastructure managed by the cloud provider. Users can access their desktop environment from a wide variety of devices, including PCs, laptops, tablets and some smartphones.

- **Amazon WorkSpaces**: Managed virtual desktops in the cloud (DaaS) - _AWS_.
