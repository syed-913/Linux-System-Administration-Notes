### **Introduction**  

**Alhamdulillah!** During my journey of mastering **Linux System Administration** through Al-Nafi‚Äôs **Diploma in Cloud Cyber Security (DCCS) track**, I meticulously documented each lecture to ensure a deep and structured understanding of core Linux concepts.  

The curriculum provided a comprehensive and in-depth exploration of **Red Hat Linux**, covering essential system administration principles. While each lecture was extensive, the depth of knowledge and practical insights gained made the time investment highly rewarding. In addition to the structured coursework, I expanded my learning through **self-research, external resources, and practical implementation**, enabling a holistic grasp of Linux fundamentals.  

These notes serve as an invaluable resource for **beginners and intermediate learners** who seek to strengthen their understanding of Linux from both **theoretical and practical perspectives**. To maximize usability and organization, I recommend using **[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download)** for reading and structuring the content effectively.
